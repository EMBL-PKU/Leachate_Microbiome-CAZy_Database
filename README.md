## Leachate_Microbiome&CAZy_Database


The 1168 non-redundant MAGs, including both archaeal and bacterial genomes, from landfill leachate samples collected in eight cities across China. 
The 1168 rMAGs encoded 67932 CAZymes, including 32517 glycoside hydrolases (GHs), 21174 glycosyl transferases (GTs), 8366 carbohydrate esterases (CEs), 3978 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), 1118 auxiliary activities (AAs), and 779 polysaccharide lyases (PLs).
